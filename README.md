# Benjamin Panzer — Linux, Cloud, and Cybersecurity

I focus on building secure and reliable Linux and cloud environments using RHEL, Ubuntu, Proxmox, Ansible, Kubernetes, and multiple cloud platforms. My work emphasizes structure, automation, and clear documentation—bringing stability and repeatability to everything I build.

I am currently completing the Information Technology Professional Diploma (TriOS College, March 2026) with consistently strong academic performance, including a 96.33% final grade in Server, Cloud & Automation Technologies. My recent projects demonstrate practical experience in hybrid cloud design, automation workflows, Linux administration, and security fundamentals.

## Key Projects

### Hybrid Cloud Automation Project (SCAT Final — 96.33%)

Designed and deployed a hybrid cloud environment integrating:

- A Proxmox private cloud  
- Ansible control node (LXC), Linux web server, Windows Server Core, Kubernetes development node  
- A public Ubuntu server on OCI  
- Automated configuration and deployment across Linux and Windows  
- Baseline storage and performance metrics  
- Full documentation with diagrams, configurations, and playbooks  

This project strengthened my skills in automation, hybrid networking, and environment orchestration.

### RHEL Hardening & Administration Toolkit

Active development of a RHEL hardening framework, SELinux rules, firewalld baselines, auditd configuration, and CLI tools stored under:
