# Benjamin Panzer — Linux, Cloud, and Cybersecurity

I focus on building secure, reliable, and well-structured Linux and cloud environments. My work emphasizes disciplined engineering practices: clear documentation, thoughtful system design, automated configuration, and repeatable workflows. I enjoy working with RHEL, Ubuntu, Proxmox, Ansible, Kubernetes, and modern cloud platforms, building systems that operate predictably and are easy to maintain.

I am currently completing the Information Technology Professional Diploma (TriOS College, March 2026) with consistently high academic performance, including a 96.33% final grade in Server, Cloud & Automation Technologies. My projects reflect practical experience in hybrid cloud architecture, Linux administration, automation, and security fundamentals.

## Current Work

My current focus is building a strong foundation in core Linux, cloud, and security engineering, including:

- Linux system administration (RHEL + Ubuntu)  
- SELinux, firewalld, journald, systemd  
- Bash scripting, Python fundamentals, and CLI tooling  
- Ansible for automated configuration across Linux and Windows  
- Kubernetes fundamentals (kubeadm, containerd)  
- Docker containers, images, and basic orchestration concepts  
- Documentation-driven workflows and consistent operational practices  

This work supports a long-term goal of developing into a well-rounded engineer capable of designing, securing, and automating multi-platform systems in hybrid environments.

## Key Projects

### Hybrid Cloud Automation Project (SCAT Final — 96.33%)

Designed and deployed a hybrid cloud environment that included:

- A Proxmox-based private cloud with multiple Linux and Windows systems  
- An Ansible control node (LXC), Linux web server, Windows Server Core, and Kubernetes development node  
- A public Ubuntu server hosted on Oracle Cloud (OCI)  
- Automated provisioning and configuration across all systems using Ansible  
- Baseline storage, performance metrics, and complete documentation  
- Diagrams, inventory structure, and reproducible steps for future deployment  

This project strengthened my understanding of hybrid cloud networking, automation workflows, and multi-system orchestration—skills directly applicable to enterprise environments.

### RHEL Hardening & Administration Toolkit

Currently developing a structured toolkit focused on:

- SELinux configuration and troubleshooting  
- firewalld rulesets and service-level hardening  
- auditd setup and tuning  
- Bash utilities for repeatable admin tasks  
- A modular, step-by-step RHEL hardening script  
- A clean, maintainable repository structure for Linux administration  

This work is part of an ongoing effort to refine secure baselines and administrative tools across RHEL systems.

### Cybersecurity & Pentesting Practice

Hands-on experience working with:

- Nessus Essentials and OpenVAS  
- Hydra, Responder, CrackMapExec  
- Wireshark for traffic and protocol analysis  
- Authentication testing, misconfiguration discovery, and exposure analysis  
- Documentation of findings, risk categorization, and remediation planning  

This practical work informs my approach to system design and hardening—understanding both how systems fail and how to defend them.
